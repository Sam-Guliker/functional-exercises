# functional-exercises
I will post some of my exercises to manipulate array's.

## Objectives
I will try to learn a bit more of functional programming.
First I'll start with looping examples. After that I will try to re-write it using the _higher order functions_

## Higher order functions.
Higher order functions are functions in functions. This is usefull
to composite functions. For example you can make smaller functions in a bigger function.

### Data objects
```
var animals = [
    { name: 'Fluffyskins', species: 'Rabbit' },
    { name: 'Caro',        species: 'Dog' },
    { name: 'Hamilton',    species: 'Dog' },
    { name: 'Harold',      species: 'Cat' },
    { name: 'Ursula',      species: 'Fish' }
]

var orders = [
    { amount: 250 },
    { amount: 400 },
    { amount: 100 },
    { amount: 325 }
]
